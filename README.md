![Alt Text](https://github.com/RobertCarrUTA/Running-Game-Python/blob/Adding-The-Sprite-Class-(OOP-in-Pygame)/gifs/run.gif)

## Compile Instructions
You will need to have Python installed on your machine. After this you will need to make sure you have Pygame installed. One Windows you can enter the following command into the terminal:
* pip install pygame

On Windows, open the folder in VSCode and run the program in the terminal by entering:
* python run.py

## Known Issues
The path strings will become messed up on some systems. I am trying to fix it.
